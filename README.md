# NOI.PH_elimination_2022
These are my C++ solutions for some of the problems in the 2022 NOI.PH Elimination Round.
I also included write-ups for each solution (write-ups.pdf) to explain the underlying
concepts, proofs, and implementation details for each problem. For the other problems, I 
am still trying to figure out a way to fully solve them.
